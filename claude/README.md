# Claude Code R Workspace Guide

Setup files for VS Code R development with Claude Code integration.

## Setup Order

1. `r-setup-notes.md` - R environment, GPU acceleration, detailed configuration
2. `mcp-setup.md` - Connect Claude Code to R via MCP
3. `install_clauder.R` - Script to install ClaudeR package

## Ground Rules

- Prefer VS Code over RStudio for development
- Use the user R library unless told otherwise
- Keep ClaudeR server running during Claude Code sessions
