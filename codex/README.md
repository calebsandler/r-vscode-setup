# Codex R Workspace Guide

Setup files for VS Code R development with Codex CLI integration.

## Setup Order

1. `vscode-r-setup.md` - VS Code and R configuration
2. `validation.md` - Verify the setup works
3. `mcp-setup.md` - Connect Codex CLI to R via MCP
4. `troubleshooting.md` - Common fixes

## Ground Rules

- Prefer VS Code over RStudio for development
- Use the user R library unless told otherwise
- Use full `code` CLI path if not in PATH
