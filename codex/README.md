# Codex R Workspace Guide

Use these files to set up VS Code for R development on this machine and keep
the process repeatable.

## Order

1) `codex/vscode-r-setup.md`
2) `codex/validation.md`
3) `codex/troubleshooting.md`

## Ground rules

- Prefer VS Code over RStudio for development.
- Use the user R library unless told otherwise.
- Use the full `code` CLI path if `code` is not in PATH.
